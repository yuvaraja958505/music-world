            <h1>Songs About Nature and the Environment</h1>
    <h3>
        by Catharine Hannay, founder of MindfulTeachers.org<br> <br>

Continuing the popular series of Song Playlists for Teachers, here are a variety of songs about about protecting the environment, appreciating nature, and treating all creatures with respect and compassion. <br> <br>

Teachers, please note: With such a multicultural audience teaching young children through adults, I can’t guarantee that all of the songs and videos will be appropriate for your particular context. I’ve included brief descriptions to help you choose, but please preview anything you plan to share with your students.
